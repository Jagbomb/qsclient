# Quantified Self Client


This project is an experimental work for a master thesis created by [Rémy Hannequin](https://github.com/rhannequin) and [Hervé Tran](https://github.com/Jagbomb). It works with the Quantified Self API (https://github.com/rhannequin/qsapi).

## How to run it

    cd qsclient

:exclamation: If your `$PATH` doesn't contain `./node_modules/.bin`, you have to install several packages globally:

    (sudo) npm install -g express nodemon jasmine-node

Then install locally the project requirements and run the app:

    npm install
    nodemon app.js

`[TODO]` You may need to exit the command once the tests have passed.
